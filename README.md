# Loan-Prediction
I have created a model to predict on the loan status, wheather loan should be approved or rejected using R. 
I have used different techniques to bifurcate how accuracy differs with different techniques. Also, which technique will be useful.  
I have used Logistic Technique, Decision Tree, Random Forrest within same code.
